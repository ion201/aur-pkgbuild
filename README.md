# X-Apps PKGBUILD

About repository
---------
Archlinux PKGBUILD files for Linux Mint X-Apps project. The aim of this repository is to create AUR files to compile and bring the X-Apps created by the Linux Mint Team to all users of Archlinux and derivatives (Archlinux, Antergos, Manjaro and others)

About X-Apps
---------
From the Linux Mint blog page and Segfault blog:
"X-Apps will be a collection of generic GTK3 applications using traditional interfaces which can be used as default desktop components in Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce. The ideas are the following:

1. To use GTK3.
2. To use a traditional UI (titlebars, menubars).
3. To be generic, desktop-agnostic and distro-agnostic.
4. To provide the functionality users already enjoy (or enjoyed in the past for distributions which already lost some functionality).
5. To be backward-compatible (hopefully all the way to GTK 3.10)."
